                                                                      🕹️ Game Overview:
Escape the Maze is a simple text-based adventure game where the player ('Z') must navigate a randomly generated board while avoiding the dragon and collecting money.

The board size is randomly determined between 5x5 and 10x10.
The player ('Z') starts at a random position inside the board.
There are special entities on the board:
💰 Money ('@') – Collect it to maximize your victory!
🐉 Dragon ('M') – Avoid this! If you land on it, the game ends.
⚠️ Trap ('T') – Reach it after collecting money to win!
🎮 Gameplay Mechanics:
The game takes player input (up, down, left, right) to move across the board.
Borders ('X') prevent movement beyond the grid.
The game ends when the player either:
Collects money and reaches the trap (Win with money ✅).
Reaches the trap without money (Win but no money 😕).
Gets caught by the dragon (Game Over ❌).
